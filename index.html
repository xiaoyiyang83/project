    <h1> US unemployment rate analysis</h1>

    <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>

    <p>Understanding the US unemployment rate is crucial for assessing
        the health of the economy and the well-being of its citizens. 
        The unemployment rate represents the percentage of people in 
        labor force who are actively seeking employment but are unable
        to find jobs. This metric serves as a key indicator of economic
         performance, reflecting the availability of job opportunities 
         and the overall level of economic activity. </p>

    <p>Monitoring the unemployment rate provides insights into 
        various aspects of the economy, such as consumer spending,
         business confidence, and government policies' effectiveness.
        A high unemployment rate may indicate economic downturns, 
        leading to decreased consumer spending, reduced business 
        investments, and potential social unrest. Conversely, 
        a low unemployment rate signifies a robust economy with 
        ample job opportunities, contributing to higher consumer 
        confidence and economic growth.</p>

    <p>Several social factors are closely related to the unemployment
         rate. Persistent unemployment can lead to financial hardships,
          increased poverty rates, and reduced access to essential 
          services, such as healthcare and education. Moreover, 
          unemployment may exacerbate existing social inequalities, 
          disproportionately affecting marginalized communities, 
          including minorities, youth, and individuals with lower 
          educational attainment.</p>

    <p>To learn more about the US unemployment rate and its implications,
         you can visit the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics website</a> or explore 
         analysis reports from reputable research organizations like 
         <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/">Pew Research Center</a>.</p>

    <h3>Introduction to the data</h3>

    <p> Our analysis makes use of two datasets. the first data is 
        a data set called `us_statewide_crime.csv` which contains 
        the following crime statistics for all US states and the 
        District of Columbia in 2010. The data has 50 rows with 9 
        features. The detail information about the features are listed
        in the following table:</p>  

        <div class="center">
        <table class="tg">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th class="tg-0lax">Variable Name</th>
                <th class="tg-0lax">Details</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td class="tg-0lax">State</td>
                <td class="tg-0lax">State name</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="tg-0lax">Violent_Crime</td>
                <td class="tg-0lax">Violent crime rate (per 100,000 residents)</td>
              </tr>

                <td class="tg-0lax">Murder rate (per 100,000 residents)</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="tg-0lax">Poverty</td>
                <td class="tg-0lax">Percent of residents below the poverty rate</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="tg-0lax">High_School</td>
                <td class="tg-0lax">Percent of residents with a high school degree</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="tg-0lax">College</td>
                <td class="tg-0lax">Percent of residents with a four-year college degree</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="tg-0lax">Single_Parent</td>
                <td class="tg-0lax">Percent of children living in single parent families</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="tg-0lax">Unemployed</td>
                <td class="tg-0lax">Unemployment rate</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="tg-0lax">Metropolitan</td>
                <td class="tg-0lax">Percent of residents living in a metropolitan area</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
            </table>

        <p>Meanwhile, we also believe that the geographical 
            information is important when evaluating the unemployment
            rate. Therefore, we also make use of geographical information 
            on <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/">Natural Earth</a>. 
            The website provides the geographical information for making maps for US states. 
        </p>

        <p>To make a better data visualization, we remove the Alaska and Hawaii
            from the data. Following is an interactive map for the 
            lower 48 states in US. User can zoom in the map. The color
            indicates the unemployment rate for each state. When click any 
            state, other social factors will be revealed for the state. </p>

            </div>
            
            <p>In general, west coast states tend to have higher 
                unemployment rate. On the east coast, West virginia 
                and New York state tend to have higher unemplyment rate
                than the others. In the south, Mississippi and Louisiana
                are the ones with the much higher unemplyment rate.
            </p>

        <h3>Overview of the Unemployment rate</h3>
        
        <div class = 'container'>
            <div class = 'image'>
                <!-- <iframe src="histogram/index.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>-->
                <iframe src="histogram/finish.png" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            </div>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p> First, we present an overview of the unemployment rate
                    for all 50 states. Alaska is the one with the 
                    highest unemployment rate, which may due to the seasonal 
                    business in the state. The effectiveness of labor market 
                    policies and governance structures can influence unemployment 
                    rates. Washington, D.C., being the seat of government, may 
                    experience fluctuations in employment related to government 
                    spending and policies. Mississippi and Louisiana have economies 
                    that are heavily reliant on sectors such as agriculture, 
                    manufacturing, and energy. Economic downturns or fluctuations 
                    in these industries can impact employment opportunities. 
                    Connecticut, South Dakota and Virginia have the lowest 
                    unemplyment rate. These states often have diverse economies 
                    with strong sectors such as technology, healthcare, finance, 
                    and tourism. A diverse economy can provide more resilience to 
                    economic downturns.

        <h3> The relationship between unemployment rate and other social factors</h3>

        <div class = 'container'>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>Moreover, we also want to examine the relationship between
                    unemployment rate and other social factors in the data. All 
                    features are numerical thus we firts create a correlation
                    plot to examine whether there are linear relationship between 
                    unemployment rate with other social factors. Notice that if 
                    the correlation is small, it only means that there is no potential
                    linear relationship between two features. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on the correlation plot, among all the features, poverty 
                    has the strongest correlation with the unemployment rate since
                    they are both related to the economics. The percentage of single 
                    parents is the second important feature which inidicates the 
                    stability of family is also strongly related to the job market. 
                    The increase of unemployment rate may also related to the increase 
                    of violent crime and murder rate but has a negative relationship
                    with education indicators, like the percentage of people who go to
                    high school and college. The only variable that has no direct linear
                    relation with the unemployment rate is Metropolitan, which means the 
                    percent of residents living in a metropolitan area. 
                </p>

            </div>   
        </div>

        <p>We have also create an interactive scatter plot so that 
            our users can select a couple of states within
            a certain range of unemployment rate and to see how the 
            other factors may be related here. 
        </p>

        <div class = 'center'>
            <iframe src="scatter.html" width="85%" height="550px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>

        <h3>Compare MA to the other states</h3>

        <p>
            Since we are in MA, thus we want to take a closer look between
            MA and other states. We create the following interactive plot
            such that user can choose another state to compare with MA and 
            show the bar plot on each factors. 
        </p>

        <div class = 'center'>
            <iframe src="summary.html" width="95%" height="300px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>

        <h3>Summary and additional work</h3>

        <p>
            In this visualization analysis, we try to explore the US 
            unemployment rate across states. We also examine the relation
            between unemployment rate and other social factors. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, this is the 2010 data thus may be different 
            than the current economics status. Also, unemployment rate 
            may fluctuate seasonally thus adding a time series analysis
            will be more informative.
